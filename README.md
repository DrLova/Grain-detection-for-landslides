Welcome to Gradeland (Grain-detection-for-landslides)

Run the main.py file and follow  the steps in the GUI to extract the grain size
distribution. To create a  NVM file (photogrammetric 3D model), you can utilize
the free and  open-source  tool 'COLMAP', which  is available  for  download at
https://colmap.github.io/index.html. Gradeland self-integrates with COLMAP, but
please ensure to  modify the 'colmap_path.txt' file. Replace the  current  path
with the relative path of the directory where 'COLMAP.bat' is located.
